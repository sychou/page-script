# Insert Text at Cursor

This example shows how to insert text at the current cursor position. This is the default behavior when no output mode is specified and no text is selected.

The script will place the returned text exactly where your cursor is currently positioned in the document.

```javascript
return "Hello, World!";
```

**What this does:**
- Returns a simple string
- Text gets inserted at the cursor position
- Cursor moves to the end of the inserted text
- This is the most basic PageScript example
